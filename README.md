#### Code formatting, fixing and testing on pre commit

It's very important to keep code clean to maintain readability and productivity. In the boilerplate, Eslint, Prettier and Jest configuration are done. It's continuously checking and format your code while you coding (Please enable "Format on Save" option if you prefer to format code after save change). After you submit changes, pre commit script will run to handle checking and formatting your code, run test. If the 3 steps are passed, you will be able to push the change.
